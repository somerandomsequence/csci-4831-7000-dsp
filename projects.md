## Assignment 0: Fork Repo

At each project checkpoint students will provide a link to their working github.com repository. This repository can be private or public but must be shared with the instructors and GSS. The git repo must follow the basic template provided, which can be forked using the link below:

[https://git.cs.colorado.edu/phillict/csci-4831-7000](https://git.cs.colorado.edu/phillict/csci-4831-7000)

In particular, this must contain all analysis code, data (if applicable and non-sensitive), research paper draft (LaTeX format and PDF), and readings writeups (in markdown format).

The 'grademe' branch will be used for grading. If the grademe branch doesn't exist, the 'master' branch will be used instead.

To complete this assignment:

  * Login to git.cs.colorado.edu
  * Fork the repository linked above (click 'Fork')
  * Go to the settings of your new forked repo
  * Click 'members' and add Caleb, Lindy, Anirudh, and Mike
  
## Assignment 1: Project Ideas & Research Questions

In this first checkpoint on your progress, you need to come up with one or more serious project ideas along with research questions that can be explored in the scope of this class. 

To complete this assignment:

  * Create a new file in your repo named 'ideas.md' in the project directory
  * Put in here a description of your project idea(s) and the research questions numbered like Q1, Q2, Q3, etc.
  * If possible, describe where and how you will get data in support of these research questions
  * Identify any barriers or risks in getting the data you need or completing the analysis 

For instance:

```
I would like to understand how weather and climate trends influence the population size of Pikas in the Colorado front range.

My research questions are:

Q1: Is the population size of pikas declining or increasing in the last 20 years?
Q2: Is the observed population size of pikas correlated with rainfall, average temperature, or drought?

The data I hope to use is collected by the Front Range Pika Projact (FPPP) at http://www.pikapartners.org/cwis438/websites/FRPP/Home.php?WebSiteID=18

I plan to use historic weather data from National Weather Service stations.

A potential risk in doing this analysis, is that it is not clear how much data on pikas is available or for how long. I have contacted FPPP to find out how much data they have and if they will share it with me.

If I'm unable to obtain the data I need for this study, I'm also interested in ...
```

During your 1-1 meeting with Caleb and Lindy, you'll discuss these ideas, research questions, data and the risks you see.
