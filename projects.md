## Github Template

At each project checkpoint students will provide a link to their working github.com repository. This repository can be private or public but must be shared with the instructors and GSS. The git repo must follow the basic template provided, which can be forked using the link below:

[https://git.cs.colorado.edu/phillict/csci-4831-7000](https://git.cs.colorado.edu/phillict/csci-4831-7000)

In particular, this must contain all analysis code, data (if applicable and non-sensitive), research paper draft (LaTeX format and PDF), and readings writeups (in markdown format).

The 'grademe' branch will be used for grading. If the grademe branch doesn't exist, the 'master' branch will be used instead.
