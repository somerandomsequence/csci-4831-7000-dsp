title: Recitations
---

During 1-1 meeting sessions, we'll use class-time for recitations. The goal of this is to introduce you to the application of
data science techniques that may not be integral to your own project:

  * Recitation 1: [Understanding Happiness](/r/happiness)
  * Recitation 2: [Forecasting Temperature](/r/temperature)
